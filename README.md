# ATmega32A


ATmega32A is an 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR microcontroller architecture. It is a low-power CMOS device that is designed to replace the ATmega32. The ATmega32A offers a wide range of features, including:

•	32 KB of In-System Programmable Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities
•	2 KB of EEPROM
•	2 KB of SRAM
•	8-channel 10-bit ADC
•	32 general-purpose I/O lines
•	Multiple timers/counter modules
•	USART, SPI, and I2C serial communication interfaces
•	JTAG and On-chip Debugging support
The ATmega32A is widely used in embedded systems, particularly in industrial automation, automotive, and robotics applications. It is also used in hobbyist projects due to its low cost and ease of use. The microcontroller can be programmed using a variety of programming languages, including C and assembly, and can be programmed using a variety of programming tools, including the Arduino IDE.
